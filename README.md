# The PHP Continuous Integration with Jenkins playground

Curious about http://jenkins-php.org/ and now looking for a test project 
to do a real quickstart?

1. Visit http://jenkins-php.org/ and follow the instructions on required Jenkins plugins and 
PHP tools, and how to use the job template
2. Install the Jenkins git plugin
3. Enter this repository URL in the job's source code management section
4. Run a build job

If you have trouble with checking out from this git repository try "Skip internal 
tag" in the SCM section, e.g. see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11122913/jenkinsgit-tell-me-who-you-are-error-why-does-it-need-to-tag
