# The PHP Continuous Integration with Jenkins playground

Stumbled upon http://jenkins-php.org/ and now looking for a test project 
to do a quickstart?

1) Follow the instructions on http://jenkins-php.org/
2) Install the Jenkins git plugin
3) Enter this repository URL in the job's source code management section
4) Do a build

If you have trouble with checking out from this git repository try "Skip internal 
tag" in the SCM section, e.g. see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11122913/jenkinsgit-tell-me-who-you-are-error-why-does-it-need-to-tag
